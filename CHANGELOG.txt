1) (@dshadowwolf and others) Sync to latest code in current conjoined BaseMetals to get bugfixes and API updates.
2) (@faceofcat) Add GUI interface wrappers and layer
3) (@faceofcat) Add Capabilities wrapper and layers - this is extensible and has hooks for latching all existing power systems equally
4) (@dshadowwolf) Implement MMDLib specific startup events and ordering properly
5) (@dshadowwolf) Remove interdependency of MMDToolEffects and some other pieces
6) (@dshadowwolf) Update MMDMaterial to have hooks for providing a means to get a custom FluidBlock and custom Tooltips on a per-material basis, the tooltips store on a per-item basis
7) (@dshadowwolf) Move Tool effects and Armor effects to the "MMDMaterialProperty" system - note that the current form is limited to replicating ***EXACTLY*** what existed before and work needs to be done to make it so that it can apply in a generic manner to any item or block
